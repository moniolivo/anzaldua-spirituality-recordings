I worked at a place where everybody--\n\nAmy: Had their chart done.\n\nCherrie: Yes. Where a person who was-- I worked in this house food place and then a woman who did a lot of astrology had done my chart but between breaks she would show me it.\n\nAmy: Oh, I see.\n\nCherrie: It wasn't like we had a real formal thing.\n\nAmy: I get you. All right, well, but you're familiar with how a chart is set up, aren't you?\n\nCherrie: Yes.\n\nAmy: The fact that there are planets, and signs, and houses and that kind of stuff.\n\nCherrie: Yes.\n\nAmy: Well, what I'll do then is first of all I'm just going to talk about your chart as a whole and give you an overview. The second thing I'll do is talk about your sun sign, your rising sign, and your moon sign, and how they fit together, and how they work. The third thing I'll do if we have time is to go through each house individually and talk about what's in each house until I get around to the whole again. Okay?\n\nCherrie: Okay.\n\nAmy: For sure if you have any questions or comments or anything to just go right ahead.\n\nCherrie: Okay.",

        "value": "Amy: Well, the first thing I want to talk about as far as your chart goes is the fact that you do have two major aspects in your chart. What that means is that when you were born Cherrie, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it's not that common either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they're very important because they tend to color everything else in the chart.\nYou have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T-square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit together. However, X can be anything, Cherrie. That X could be a relationship, it could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect body.\nIt could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I thought about it again and I realized that's not really X, this is X instead. If you do decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it, for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the feeling of just like gee, this isn't quite right, it isn't quite working. You really feel oh I have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me.\nIt's really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet, and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, \"Oh what a stupid outlet, it isn't working, I got to go find another outlet.\" What the T-square is saying is that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused because you have an imbalance of energy.\nNow you're not doomed to the short circuit. It's not saying to you, \"Oh, well, tough luck, Cherrie, for the rest of your life you're going to be like this.\" It's saying no, okay there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a special kind of T-square, because it doesn't just involve planets. It also involves these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at all.\nIf you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the earth's moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents getting sucked into past life karma.\n\nCherrie: Great.",

That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, \"Okay this is it. I really have to deal with this energy.\" What the imbalance is about, is connected to these planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is conjunct, which means it's just totally together with right on top of your self node which is past life karma.\nWhat this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that your power was your work. It wasn't just powerful personally maybe you were in a situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It's saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and said, \"Yes, this is who I am. I'm the power and what I want is right for everybody.\"",
