## **Annotating Spirituality in the Gloria Evangelina Anzaldúa Papers**

I wonder if the academic world, which has so much of what I want, is too narrow and rigid for me to fit into. And then…I hear you speak, and I think all I need to do is to continue; being myself, thinking, writing, speaking, listening, reading, taking risks. The risks that you have taken, and continue to take, are such a gift to me. Your voice validates my being in a loving way. I thank you.
—Correspondence to Anzaldua, 1993

what have you given me? mostly yourself… your story… i’m not sure of the words.
—Correspondence to Anzaldua, 1985

Tamara, I miss you and I love you. In the past week or two my thoughts return to you again and again. You see, I am writing a book on fusing politics with spirituality and you are in it. Your teaching is in it. Meditations I did as a result of taking your class are in it. The spiritual breakthru’s that you inspired are in it. I want to hear your voice. I’m sending you a tape.
—Anzaldua to Tamara Dhiaghilev, 1982

In a quiet room, you pull a CD from a paper envelope and place it in the drive of a desktop computer; it’s a copy of a tape recording from 1983. When you press it shut, the drive tray makes a small and satisfying click against your fingertip. The disk begins to whirr, suddenly the loudest thing in the room. You put in your earbuds and are surprised to remember the sound of your own breath. When was the last time you listened? The audio starts playing: First, a thick clack and the muffled grazing of hands over the microphone. Then, the gentle clatter of the tape recorder set down upon a hard surface. You hear a woman’s voice: 
<br>
“What’s today?”
<br>
“I don’t know…I think it’s the 9th…”
<br>
“Today is July 9th, and Chela’s gonna read my palms. How about that?”

<br><br>
Housed at the Benson Latin American Collection, the Gloria Anzaldua Papers contain hundreds of cassette tapes recorded by the Chicana Feminist writer and theorist. The recordings document interviews, lectures, workshops, speeches, and oral histories; they also document Anzaldua´s interest in spirituality as a method of research and writing. Around 300 cassette tapes recorded and collected between the late 1970s and the early 2000s indicate that audio was a technology and medium Anzaldua embraced. Looking at her correspondence and manuscripts, the tapes are also evidence that Anzaldua centered her spiritual practice as a form of research. Between 1980 and 1983, Anzaldua recorded three palm readings she received: one from a palmist in New York, another from a metaphysical practitioner in San Francisco, and another from her friend and contemporary, Chela Sandoval.

It is a remarkable feeling to sit in an archive’s reading room, surrounded by views of a parking lot and a football field, listening to a forty-year-old audio recording and having the sense of being in the room where Chela Sandoval is reading Gloria Anzaldua’s palm. What is at work here? First, the materiality of the medium primes us to be in a state of recollection. The quality of audiocassette recordings is distinct; even in high-quality recordings, the medium itself is always apparent in the granular hiss of magnetic tape playback. Cassette tape recordings don’t have the crackling warmth of an LP, for example. They are raw in how they expose the mechanics of the medium. The handling of the recorder, the terse click of the buttons, and the hushed and whining creak of the spools evoke the physical memory of clasping the door of a Walkman shut, or of handling the considerable weight of a shoebox recorder. The sound quality of the tape is inevitable, creating a sonic environment that the body perceives as memory. Tape recorders also capture air and atmosphere quite well. Listen to audio recorded on a hot day, and the air will sound round and mellow. You’ll hear air conditioners and table fans, maybe even outdoor sounds from an open window or a screen door. There is place and intimacy in this kind of sound.

The closeness of Sandoval and Anzaldua is immediately apparent in the recording. In the first moments of the session, Sandoval asks Anzaldua which is her dominant hand. The answer, according to Anzaldua, is complicated because she was ambidextrous as a small child until she was eventually forced to write with her right hand. As they work together to figure out the best way to proceed, the women talk over each other, asking and answering their questions at the same time without missing a beat. Throughout the reading, Anzaldua frequently interjects with questions about the methodology and technique of palmistry.

To a native Tejana, Anzaldua’s vocal character reminds me of the voices of women in my family. Many afternoons of my childhood were spent eavesdropping from beneath my ‘buelita’s kitchen table. On weekends and holidays, my grandmother, mother, and aunts sat in the kitchen, talking and laughing for hours over coffee and pan dulce. I would pretend to play, covertly deciphering stories about family, neighbors, and novela characters through overlapping Spanish and English. For so many young Chicanas, this is how we learn from our femme elders; their stories become our stories until we live enough to sit at the table and tell our own. Recalling the felt sense of observing Chicana elders is how I find myself in the room with Sandoval and Anzaldua, recognizing myself in the negative space of the recording.

Anzaldua’s presence in the tape anchors the listener to the sonic experience of listening in the archive. When Sandoval assesses Anzaldua’s character through the palm reading, Anzaldua embodies vulnerability by freely admitting and expanding on her perceived weaknesses, mutability, and strengths. At several points in their conversation, Anzaldua compares the lines of her hand to Sandoval’s, and a shift occurs between the women, where they are now reading each other’s palms. Through this recording, we understand Anzaldua’s spiritual practice as a form of plática. Anzaldua learns about herself as much as she does about Sandoval and about palmistry. Her authenticity and vulnerability allow us to encounter her in the archive—recognizing her. Like the sound of our own breath.
